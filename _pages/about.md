About me pages are usually bullshit, I am not a fan of bullshit.

I find things.

I like to make and fix stuff (I don't like painting walls).

I write lots of bash scripts. Prefers Arch Linux as a replacement for MacOS (does not recommend erasing the recovery partition because firmware).

Handy when mistakes have been made. Have made many mistakes, have fixed more.
