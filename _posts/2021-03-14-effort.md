If someone wants to be in your life they will be there.

If someone wants to see you, then they will.

They arenâ€™t too busy, their priorities were elsewhere. If you were a priority they would make the time, they would be there.

Effort is directly proportional to the amount of interest someone has in you. 

If someone wants to be with you then they will be.
