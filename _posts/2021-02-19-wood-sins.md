Thou **Shalt Not** paint antiques and heirloom furniture for any reason. Especially if you were *“just going to put it in the trash anyway”*. People drive around hoping other people will be stupid enough to throw antiques away. If you paint an antique or refurbish it to the point of it looking modern or replicated it looses almost all value.


Thou **Shalt Never** stain cedar. What the fuck is wrong with you? Who hurt you? Why would you do this? It’s cedar!
