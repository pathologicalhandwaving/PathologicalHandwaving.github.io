People particularly property managers use two terms interchangably to their detriment all too often. Those two terms are *maintenance* and *repairs*. Mixing the two up can create a mess of difficulties and frustration.

  - Maintenance: From *maintain*, to keep in a certain state.

  - Repair: The act of putting something in working order again.
  

## Examples of Maintenance

  Oil changes, tire rotation, tune ups to your vehicle are examples of maintenance.
  
  For a property examples of maintenance are mowing the grass, cleaning out the gutters, changing out air filters, testing smoke detectors, and so on.
  

## Examples of Repairs

  Changing a flat tire, replacing a cracked windshield, replacing crushed bumpers, are all examples of vehicle repairs.
  
  For a property common repair tasks may include fixing a leak in the roof, replacing broken windows, fixing holes in walls, and so on.
  

## Why are these Differences Important?

  Both must be budgeted for separately. A maintenance budget needs to be kept on hand, you can easily estimate annual maintenance costs and needs. Budgeting for repairs can be a tricky. You might not anticipate the extent of damages for a hurricane or major storm.
  
  More importantly, repairs can be a sign of lax maintenance. If your gutters are not maintained or your HVAC leaks these can cause large scale damage that could have been avoided if they were maintained properly.
