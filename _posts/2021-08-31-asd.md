Here it is:

I have ADHD and I also have autism. 

I try to keep my head down, not get into anyone's drama, all the shit my therapist told me. 

  - Breathe
  - Remember its not about you
  - Be compassionate
  - Show empathy
  - Dont get provoked

Over a year into a pandemic with oncea year therapy and I'd say I've handled it really well aside from the occassional drinking.


But mentally I am not in good shape. 

Do all of you neurotypicals and people who could pass as such not understand how incredibly hard it is to pass for one of you? 

I'm failing horribly.
