> Immanuel Kant was a real pissant\
> Who was very rarely stable  \
> Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar \  
> Who could think you under the table  \
> David Hume could out-consume  \
> Wilhelm Freidrich Hegel  \
> And Wittgenstein was a beery swine  \
> Who was just as schloshed as Schlegel \  
> There's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya  \
> 'bout the raising of the wrist  \
> Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed  \
> John Stuart Mill, of his own free will  \
> On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill  \
> Plato, they say, could stick it away  \
> Half a crate of whiskey every day  \
> Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle  \
> And Hobbes was fond of his dram  \
> And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart  \
> "I drink, therefore I am."  \
> Yes, Socrates himself is particularly missed  \
> A lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed  \
